# Artvelog Custom Redirect Page for Wordpress

I developed this plugin because I wanted to create a "redirect page" between a link and the site that will be redirected in Wordpress, and I couldn't find enough resources on this topic.
## Plugin Features

- Choose a page you have created with WordPress as a redirection page. (Supported plugins for page builders: Gutenberg, Elementor, SiteOrigin, Beaver Builder, (WPBakery - Visual Composer), additionally Ultimate Addons for Gutenberg).
- Specify a custom URL slug for your redirection page.
- You can select the HTML tag where the link is located. Whether the link is internal or external is automatically determined, and internal links to the redirection page are blocked.
- You can specify how long to wait on the redirection page.
- (X) You can add your custom HTML and PHP template code for the redirection page. (This feature is currently disabled due to security reasons. It may be enabled in future versions.)

I am not responsible for any problems that may arise from using the plugin! You can use and edit it as you wish.
